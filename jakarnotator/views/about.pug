                | Jakarto is a startup from Montreal (Qc, Canada). It aims to collect urban environment geodata thanks to cutting-edge technologies (lidars, 4K cameras).

                | Jakarto is propulsed by JLR, a company which analyzes data from millions of properties all over North America and transforms it into business intelligence for financial institutions, government agencies, private companies and real estate professionals.

            | Why did we build such a tool ?
          .card-body
            .card-text.px-md-5
              p We collected a huge amount of data each day with our trucks. We then extracted valuable information for our customers. We needed an automatic, robust and efficient data processing system.
              p Today, one of the best solutions is using machine learning and deep learning. These algorithms need tons of groundtruth data to automatically extract the concepts of cars, trees, people, buildings, traffic signs or other interesting objects during a step called training.
              p The more we annotate images, the more the training becomes efficient. Once this is achieved; we use the data model to detect real object locations with the end goal of selling this service.
              p Our algorithms have been trained on well known public datasets like COCO and Cityscape. Because our data was of such a high quality compared to the training dataset the results were good, but not ideal. Because of this, we needed to train the model yet again using our data. That meant annotating thousands of images with our own classes.
              p Because we didn't find a tool to annotate our data as fast as we wanted (understanding price, data privacy, data ownership and annotation-style (instance segmentation for us)), we decided to build our own. Here is Jakarnotator.

                li Because of the lack of public 
                  span.text-muted (and almost free)
                  |  tools to establish a groundtruth, 
                li Because we used open source IA algorithms as inspiration for free 
                  span.text-muted (resulting of years of research), 
                li Because we cannot build such a service alone 
                  span.text-muted with induced knowledge acquisition bottleneck
                li And because nowadays we make business over it, 
              p For all of those reasons, we decided to open source Jakarnotator to help the data science community. This is our kind of payback for thanking all the people/companies which build things. Jakarnotator is our way to contribute and serve this community.
